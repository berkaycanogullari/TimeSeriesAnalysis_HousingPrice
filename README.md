# TimeSeriesAnalysis_HousingPrice

## Who am I?

My name is Berkay Canogullari. I'm currently pursuing my M.S. in Data Science at the University of San Francisco, which I will be graduating in mid-August. At the same time, I'm working as a Machine Learning Researcher at the University of California, San Francisco.


## About the project

In this project, we are attempting to forecast median house prices for the year 2016 using the time series data between years 2008-2015. We tried ARIMA, SARIMA, SARIMAX, ETS, VAR, and Prophet methods for predictions. These methods vary from univariate, only using the history of house prices to predict the feature, to multivariate, using the mortgage rate and house prices, as well as historical housing prices to predict the prices in the future. Detailed analysis and the code can be found in the report and jupyter notebook respectively.

## Dataset
The Zillow dataset recorded Feb 2008-Dec 2015 monthly median sold price for housing in California, Feb 2008-Dec 2016 monthly median mortgage rate, and Feb 2008-Dec 2016 monthly unemployment rate.
